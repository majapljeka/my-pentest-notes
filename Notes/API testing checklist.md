## Heading level 2 Authentication

- [ ]  Don't use Basic Auth. Use standard authentication instead (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- [ ]  Don't reinvent the wheel in Authentication, token generation, password storage. Use the standards.
- [ ]  Use Max Retry and jail features in Login.
- [ ]  Use encryption on all sensitive data.
## Heading level 2 JWT (JSON Web Token)
- [ ] Use a random complicated key (JWT Secret) to make brute forcing the token very hard.
- [ ] Don't extract the algorithm from the header. Force the algorithm in the backend (HS256 or RS256).
- [ ] Make token expiration (TTL, RTTL) as short as possible.
- [ ] Don't store sensitive data in the JWT payload, it can be decoded easily.
- [ ] Avoid storing too much data. JWT is usually shared in headers and they have a size limit.
## Heading level 2 OAuth
- [ ] Always validate redirect_uri server-side to allow only whitelisted URLs.
- [ ] Always try to exchange for code and not tokens (don't allow response_type=token).
- [ ] Use state parameter with a random hash to prevent CSRF on the OAuth authentication process.
- [ ] Define the default scope, and validate scope parameters for each application.
