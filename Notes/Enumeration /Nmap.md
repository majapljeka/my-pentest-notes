 [Host Discovery Strategies](https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-strategies.html) |
| `nmap -v -sS -A -T4 target` | Nmap verbose scan, runs syn stealth, T4 timing, OS and service version info, traceroute and scripts against services. |
| `ping sweep sudo nmap -pn target` | Does a ping sweep over the target's network to see all the available IPs. |
| `nmap -v -sS -p–A -T4 target` | As above but scans all TCP ports (takes a lot longer). |
| `nmap -v -sU -sS -p- -A -T4 target` | As above but scans all TCP ports and UDP scan (takes even longer). |
| `nmap -v -p 445 –script=smb-check-vulns --script-args=unsafe=1 192.168.1.X` | Nmap script to scan for vulnerable SMB servers. |
| `nmap localhost` | Displays all the ports that are currently in use. |
| ` nmap -sV --open -oA nibbles_initial_scan <ip address>` | This will run a service enumeration (-sV) scan against the default top 1,000 ports and only return open ports and save in nibbles_initixyz XML output. |
| `ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/* \| grep ftp` | Search nmap scripts for keywords. |
| `nc -nv 10.129.42.190 22` | Using nc to do some banner grabbing |
| `nmap -sC -p 22,80 -oA nibbles_script_scan 10.129.42.190` | Specify which ports |
| `sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet \| grep for \| cut -d" " -f5` | Scan Network Range; -sn 	Disables port scanning. Response is based on  ICMP echo requests  |
| `sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst \| grep for \| cut -d" " -f5` | Scan IP List ; -iL 	Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.lst' list.Response is based on  ICMP echo requests |
| `sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20 \| grep for \| cut -d" " -f5` | Scan Multiple IPs |
| sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace ` | It would send an ARP ping resulting in an ARP reply. We can confirm this with the "--packet-trace" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (-PE) for this. |
| `sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping` | Scan our target with the desired ICMP echo requests |
