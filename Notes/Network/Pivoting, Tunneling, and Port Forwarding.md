## Port Forwarding

Route table:
`netstat -r`

Executing local port forwarding:
`ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64`
*We can port forward MySQL to our localhost on port 1234 and access it locally. Though, MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port 3306.*
Confirming Port Forward with Netstat:
`netstat -antp | grep 1234`
Confirming Port Forward with Nmap
`nmap -v -sV -p1234 localhost`

Forwarding Multiple Ports:
`ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64`


## Pivoting

### SOCKS tunneling
SOCKS proxies: SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that.

**Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH:** \
`ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64` \
**Checking /etc/proxychains.conf:** \
`tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf` \
**Using Nmap with Proxychains** (*it will route all the packets of Nmap to the local port 9050, where our SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the 172.16.5.0/23 network*.) \
`proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200` One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a full TCP connect scan over proxychains.  \
**Enumerating the Windows Target through Proxychains** \
`proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.19`
