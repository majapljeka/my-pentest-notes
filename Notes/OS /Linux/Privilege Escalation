Types of exploits in Privilege escalations:
1.Kernel Exploits
Example DirtyCow - https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/PoCs

2.Vulnerable Software
Check: dpkg -l command on Linux or look at C:\Program Files in Windows

3. User Privileges

    a)Sudo
    b)SUID
    c)Windows Token Privileges

sudo -l
[sudo] password for user1:
...SNIP...
User user1 may run the following commands on ExampleServer:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
==> The above output says that we can run all commands with sudo, which gives us complete access, and we can use the su command with sudo to switch to the root user: <===
sudo su -
and we are in.

sudo -l
    (user : user) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo
The NOPASSWD entry shows that the /bin/echo command can be executed without a password. This would be useful if we gained access to the server through a vulnerability and did not have the user's password. As it says user, we can run sudo as that user and not as root. To do so, we can specify the user with -u user:
==>sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello World!

4. Scheduled Tasks
   a) Add new scheduled tasks/cron jobs
   b) Trick them to execute a malicious software

Linux:
    /etc/crontab
    /etc/cron.d
