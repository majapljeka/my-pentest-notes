## Windows

LSASS

Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a collection of many modules and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in %SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe.
This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the Event log. In other words, it is the vault for Windows-based operating systems, and we can find a more detailed illustration of the LSASS architecture here.\
The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores users' passwords.\
User passwords are stored in a hash format in a registry structure as either an LM hash or an NTLM hash. This file is located in %SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM and is mounted on HKLM/SAM. SYSTEM level permissions are required to view it.

 **Authentication Packages** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Lsasrv.dll`                | The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful. |
| `Msv1_0.dll`                | Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Samsrv.dll`                | The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.                                                                                                                                       |
| `Kerberos.dll`              | Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Netlogon.dll`              | Network-based logon service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Ntdsa.dll`                 | This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.     |

Windows systems can be assigned to either a workgroup or domain during setup. If the system has been assigned to a workgroup, it handles the SAM database locally and stores all existing users locally in this database. However, if the system has been joined to a domain, the Domain Controller (DC) must validate the credentials from the Active Directory database (ntds.dit), which is stored in %SystemRoot%\ntds.dit. \

Credential Manager
`PS C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\[Vault/Credentials]\`

 Each Domain Controller hosts a file called NTDS.dit. NTDS.dit is a database file that stores the data in Active Directory, including but not limited to:

- User accounts (username & password hash)
- Group accounts
- Computer accounts
- Group policy objects
