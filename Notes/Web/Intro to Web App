If you prefer to use to a dark theme, you may do so in Burp by going to (User Options>Display) and selecting "dark" under (theme), and in ZAP by going to (Tools>Options>Display) and selecting "Flat Dark" in (Look and Feel).

Intercepting Responses:
In Burp, we can enable response interception by going to (Proxy>Options) and enabling Intercept Response under Intercept Server Responses

/etc/proxychains.conf
#socks4         127.0.0.1 9050
http 127.0.0.1 8080

proxychains curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT
nmap -h | grep -i prox
nmap --proxies http://127.0.0.1:8080 SERVER_IP -pPORT -Pn -sC

Metasploit through proxy:
msfconsole
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set PROXIES HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080
PROXIES => HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RHOST SERVER_IP
RHOST => SERVER_IP
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RPORT PORT
RPORT => PORT
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > run
